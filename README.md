# Mock React Technical Test

This project is a mock tech test, and forms part of the [Manchester Codes](https://www.manchestercodes.com/) Bootcamp.

The README will be updated as the project progresses.

## The Brief

"You are expected to build a React web application that allows users to search for images based on a query relating to space. You are provided the NASA API endpoint for image search.
We want you to consider and add anything to your repository that should be included was this to be a live website.

The following functionalities need to be implemented:

- [ ] A Search page which allows users to search for images by keyword
- [ ] Images must be returned upon a successful search

The styling is up to you but will be taken into consideration when evaluating your application.

We estimate this task to take ​​10 hours​​. Once you have completed the task upload the repository to GitHub and send the link to xxxxx@xxx.com. ​Deadline: 5 days from receiving."
